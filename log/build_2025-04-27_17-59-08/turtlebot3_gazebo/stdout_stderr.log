[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findros_gz_sim.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros_gz_sim", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros_gz_sim" with
  any of the following names:

    ros_gz_simConfig.cmake
    ros_gz_sim-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros_gz_sim" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ros_gz_sim_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ros_gz_sim" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
